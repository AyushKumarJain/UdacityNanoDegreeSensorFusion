How can we help you? Â 

09:25 AM | Ayush Kumar: Hi Ruchi, I am currently enrolled in Sensor Fusion Nano Degree Program. I want to know some more details about the Program.

09:26 AM | Ayush Kumar: Can I ask you a few questions?

09:29 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: Please go ahead.

09:31 AM | Ayush Kumar: I have been learning with Udacity from 1st April.

09:31 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: Okay

09:31 AM | Ayush Kumar: It was the free month trial.

09:32 AM | Ayush Kumar: With auto renew enabled after the month end

09:33 AM | Ayush Kumar: Is it compulsory to take the auto renewal option ?

09:33 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: Yes actually Auto renewal cannot be disabled.

09:34 AM | Ayush Kumar: Why ?

09:34 AM | Ayush Kumar: Can you please explain ?

09:34 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: This is how it is designed.

09:35 AM | Ayush Kumar: Is it compulsory to finish the degree, if started ?

09:35 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: I f you have pricing related issue Ayush, I can help you with the discounted prices that are going on.

09:36 AM | Ayush Kumar: Actually I will go to work as COVID stops.

09:36 AM | Ayush Kumar: I will then have less time to study.

09:37 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: I totally understand. How about if we push the limit to $200 USD off on all subsequent payments for this program? Â I would be happy to help and see you taking the program in this tough times. Â 

09:37 AM | Ayush Kumar: That is why I was concerned that if the billing goes on several months. It will be difficult to handle the monthly subscription fee.

09:40 AM | Ayush Kumar: The subsequent payments will last untill I finish the degree or just for the next month ?

09:44 AM | Ruchi from Udacity: Not even on the price of $300 off, See you are already a part of our team, How about $99/month till the time you graduate.

09:45 AM | Ayush Kumar: Why is this obligation ? I understand that Udacity will not want its content to be given away for Free. But it is them who offered initially a free month. Personally, that is why I took a bit freedom to choose to study on Udacity. Otherwise there are other platform with way less fee. I would have chosen that.

09:53 AM | Ayush Kumar: ?
